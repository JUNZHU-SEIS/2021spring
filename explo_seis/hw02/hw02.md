>#### In terms of earthquake detection that I study, methods used in exploration seismology may also help in two aspects:  
- The seismic siganls of quarry blasts are similar to those of natural earthquakes, thus earthquakes are misidentified as quarry blasts sometimes. For areas of active mining in which high seismic hazard lies, manual inspection is a labor-intensive task. If active sources are shot in this area, the known sources may help depict the general features of the quarry blasts.
- Nodal array has been used in earthquake seismology for long actually. By stacking some feature of the seismic signals, dense array could greatly enhance the detectability of the small events. On the contrary, the sparse stations are often blind to the weak signals. The state-of-the-art technique, distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) would be a good example of dense data acquisition.
