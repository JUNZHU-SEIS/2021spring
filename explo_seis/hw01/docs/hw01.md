## Migration methods to undo the scattering caused by mantle  heterogenity
Investigation of the lowermost mantle requires a data set of high-quality waveforms. Hence, a phase stripping technique is needed to isolate more subtle arrivals, which removes the S, ScS phases etc. Migration methods used in exploration seismology can be applied to locate scattering bodies in the lower mantle successfully.
## From time lapse seismic (TLS) to subduction zones in four dimensions ([SZ4D](https://www.sz4d.org/earthquakes))
TLS allows comparison of seismic over intervals of months or years to detect changes resulting from the production of hydrocarbons or the injection of fluids. Similarly, Faulting and Earthquake Cycles of SZ4D study the fundamental processes underlying great earthquakes, through both space and time.

In terms of true vertical depth, the **Bertha Rogers No 1 natural gas well in the Anadarko Basin** used to be the deepest in the world, at over 31,400 feet.   
In terms of vertical depth, though, **BPâ€™s Tiber field in the Gulf of Mexico, drilled by the infamous Deepwater Horizon**, became the location for the deepest oil well.
